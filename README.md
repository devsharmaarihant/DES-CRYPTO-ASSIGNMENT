# DES-CRYPTO-ASSIGNMENT
## INSTRUCTION FOR USING THIS PROJECT
1. Download and IDE (Indegrated Developement Environemnt) of your choice but VS Code would be a preferred choice since I made it using that IDE
2. Make sure you have a c++ compiler like G++ or GCC any version but any version abvoe 12v would be great option.
3. You can also install an extension called "Code Runner" in your VS Code for it's extensions tab to make your life easier other wise you can use the following line of code you compile and run your code:
     i. first write this line in your terminal after making sure that your terminal points to the folder where you have this code downloaded
     ii. suppose you name you file as: des-encry.cpp
         then write this in terminal: g++ des-encry.cpp -o des-encry
     iii. then write this: ./des-encry
4. After that line just follow the instructions and see the output.
